# Cryptocurrency Liquidity Prediction Project

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting cryptocurrency liquidity using market data and technical indicators. It includes data processing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comprehensive documentation.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and reporting
- `data/` : Raw and processed data files
- `src/` : Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and modeling
- `docs/` : Project documentation (HLD, LLD, EDA, Pipeline, Final Report)

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Open the main notebook in `notebooks/`
3. Run all cells for full analysis and results
